# NY Property Unsupervised Fraud Detection

## Project Overview

Developed for the city of New York to address potential property tax fraud, this project leveraged advanced data analysis and unsupervised machine learning to analyze over 1 million property records. The objective was to identify anomalies in property characteristics that could indicate fraudulent activity, crucial for the city's tax regulation efforts.

## Problem Statement

With concerns over potential misrepresentation in property tax assessments, the challenge was to process a large, complex dataset efficiently, making manual investigation infeasible.

## Solution Approach

Utilizing Python and unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically k-means clustering, the project focused on:
- **Data Engineering**: Creating robust data ingestion and cleaning pipelines to handle extensive missing values and ensure data integrity.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Developing algorithms to detect and prioritize unusual property data for further investigation.
- **Collaboration and Communication**: Working closely with city officials and stakeholders to refine detection methods and communicate findings effectively.

## Technical Implementation

- **Programming Language**: Python, including extensive use of data processing libraries.
- **Machine Learning**: Applied unsupervised learning to identify outliers, indicative of potential fraud.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed comprehensive data analysis to understand and interpret complex datasets, a key in developing predictive models for anomaly detection.

## Outcomes

The algorithm streamlined the investigation process by flagging high-risk records, significantly enhancing the city's ability to manage property tax compliance and reduce fraud risks.

## Impact

This initiative is estimated to contribute to an annual risk mitigation benefit valued at $10M, demonstrating significant economic and operational benefits.
